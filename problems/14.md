### 14: Key-value view

Another type of view is a key-value store, with a twist: keys can resolve to multiple values. This is because of the decentralized nature of the data. If two users write to the key `foo` while offline, then sync to eachother, they will see *both* of their entries under `foo` afterwards.

This type of key-value store tracks "links" on each message. The idea is that each message includes a list of message IDs of values that came before it, for the same key. Usually "feed-id@seq-num" is the message ID used. Here is an example of three messages that form a key-value store's history:

```js
// feed.key.toString('hex') = 61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15
[
  {
    key: '61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15',
    seq: 0,
    value: {
      key: 'foo',
      value: 'bar',
      links: []
    }
  },
  {
    key: '61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15',
    seq: 1,
    value: {
      key: 'foo',
      value: 'test',
      links: ['61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15@0']
    }
  },
  {
    key: '61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15',
    seq: 2,
    value: {
      key: 'foo',
      value: 'quux',
      links: ['61f6a31961939bc03fdfdba661a15@0']
    }
  }
]
```

#### Exercise

If seq=1 and seq=2 link back to seq=0 on this feed, what value(s) would you expect to see for the key `foo`?

Try writing a key-value view of your own with [kappa-view-kv](https://github.com/noffle/kappa-view-kv) with similar data to check your answer.
