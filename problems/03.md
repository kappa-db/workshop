### 3 - Storing and retrieving data

As mentioned previously, Hypercore is an append-only data structure. Let's try to use it to store some data and read it out again.

What if we wanted to build a peer-to-peer chat app? We might want to know the text of the message, message type, nickname, and perhaps a timestamp. Let's store messages in a specific format – using [JSON](https://json.org/) – so we can identify them as chat messages, as shown here:

```js
// Save this file as single-chat.js

var hypercore = require('hypercore')
var feed = hypercore('./single-chat-feed', {
  valueEncoding: 'json'
})

feed.append({ 
  type: 'chat-message',
  nickname: 'cat-lover',
  text: 'hello world', 
  timestamp: '2018-11-05T14:26:000Z' // new Date().toISOString()
}, function (err, seq) {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('Data was appended as entry #' + seq)
})
```

#### Exercise

Try running the above code a couple of times. You should see the entry sequence number increase each time. The entry sequence number (or `seq`) is the "key" to this data entry and you can use it to retrieve the data again using the `feed.get` api.

Try reading out the first entry (`0`) using the `feed.get` api and `console.log()` it.

It should return a JSON object similar to the one you added.

Once you solve this exercise continue to [exercise 4](https://github.com/kappa-db/workshop/blob/master/problems/04.md)
